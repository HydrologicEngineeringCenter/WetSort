# WetSort



Wetsort is used to calculate the highest 7 to 35 day continuous periods of flooding during the growing season 

(consecutive not cumulative duration).  


You only have 3 options.  Running Wetsort or Stats.  The Stats package was actually developed for Dr. Jack Killgore at 

ERDC, and they provide a suite of statistics of interest to fisheries biologists.  For Wetsort your only variables are the 

growing season and the period of record.  You change those in the GUI.
