# WetSort



Wetsort is used to calculate the highest 7 to 35 day continuous periods of flooding during the growing season 

(consecutive not cumulative duration).  


You only have 3 options.  Running Wetsort or Stats.  The Stats package was actually developed for Dr. Jack Killgore at 

ERDC, and they provide a suite of statistics of interest to fisheries biologists.  For Wetsort your only variables are the 

growing season and the period of record.  You change those in the GUI. 

 

 ========================
BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================

When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE
automatically copies all of the JAR
files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDE
also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application
JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).

To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "WetSort.jar"
